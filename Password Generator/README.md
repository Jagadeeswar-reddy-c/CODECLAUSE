# Project - 1 - Password Generator

```
Project ID: #CC9863
Project Title: Password Generator
Internship Domain: Python Development Intern
```

### Project Overview

The Password Generator project is a web application developed during my internship at CodeClause Pvt Ltd. The application is designed to generate secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, inclusion of symbols, numbers, and alphabetic characters. This project showcases my proficiency in Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### Key Features:
  - Customizable Length: Users can specify the length of the password to meet their security needs.
  - Inclusion Options: Users can choose to include symbols, numbers, and characters in the password, ensuring a high level of security.
  - User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive design for easy use.

### Technologies Used
  - `Python`: Core programming language used for backend logic.
  - `Flask`: Web framework used to build the web application.
  - `MySQL`: Not used in this specific project but part of my learning outcomes.
  - `HTML`: Markup language used for structuring the web pages.
  - `CSS`: Used for styling the web pages.
  - `Bootstrap`: Framework used for creating responsive and mobile-first web designs.
  - `Libraries`: Utilized Python's `random` and `string` libraries for password generation.

### Code Explanation
  1. Flask Application (`app.py`):
       - This part of the code sets up the Flask application and defines the routes for the web app.
  2. Password Generation Logic (`password.py`):
       - This module contains the logic for generating the password based on the user's input.
  3. HTML Template (`index.html`):
       - This HTML file structures the web page and includes a form for user inputs and displays the generated password.
